Project: To-Do List App (Backend)

Functional Requirements

1. User Registration and Authentication: Users should be able to register and authenticate themselves using a username and password. Authentication is handled with a JWT

2. Task Management: Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Each task should have a title, description, status (e.g., pending, completed), and a due date.

3. Task Prioritization: Users should be able to prioritize tasks.

Non-Functional Requirements

1. Performance: The application should be able to handle multiple requests at a time and respond quickly.

2. Security: User data should be protected, passwords should be hashed, and secure connections should be used.

3. Scalability: The application should be able to handle an increase in users and tasks.

Development Requirements

1. Code Organization: Your code should be well-structured and easy to maintain. Use appropriate design patterns.

2. Version Control: Use Git for version control.

3. Containerization: Use Docker to create a container for your application. This will make it easy to set up the project environment and run your application on any machine.

4. Database Migrations: Use Alembic (a database migration tool designed for SQLAlchemy) to handle database schema changes.

5. Error Handling: The application should handle potential errors and exceptions gracefully, providing useful error messages.

6. Environment Variables: Use environment variables to store sensitive information like database credentials.
